<h1> Soccerbots of 18-19 </h1>
<br>
<h4> the j1.py file is the code which runs on the pc and the ardcode.ino is the file which runs on the arduino </h4>
<br>
<h2> Work done so far..</h2>
<br>
<p> 1 robot fabrication including kicker and dribbler (prototype) </p>
<br>
<p> PID control of wheel angular velocities using cheap incremental encoders </p>
<br>
<p> Inverse kinematic model of robot has been derived and speeds of wheel calibrated </p>
<br>
<p> Serial communication to robot over pyserial (sending control over joystick </p>
<br>

<h2> Work in progress </h2>
<br>
<p>Implementing xbee (Third years)</p>
<br>

<h2> Work to be done by Nov 22</h2>
<br>
<p> Get acrylic parts which are in same design as the ones in foam in prototype </p>
<br>
<p> Fabricate rest of the 3 bots with acrylic based on design of prototype </p>
<br>
<p> Ability to control bots independently and ability to switch control of bots through joystick </p>
<br>
<p> Add comments to code to make it more understandable </p>
<br>

<h1> Future Goals </h1>
<h2> Will be updated based on progressn by Oct 31 </h1>
